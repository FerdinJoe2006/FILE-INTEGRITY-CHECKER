 File Integrity Checker (Python)

A Python-based File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) tool that helps detect unauthorized or accidental file modifications using cryptographic hash verification.
This project securely tracks file changes, deletions, and integrity status through a simple command-line interface.

 Features

 SHA-256 hash-based integrity verification

 Register files for continuous monitoring

 Detect file modifications, deletions, and size changes

 Persistent integrity database using JSON

 Update baseline hashes when changes are expected

 Full system scan with summarized results

 User-friendly menu-driven CLI

 Requirements

Python 3.7 or higher

No external libraries required (uses Python standard library only)

 How to Run

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-integrity-checker.git
cd file-integrity-checker


Run the program

python file_integrity_checker.py

 Menu Options
Option	Description
1	Register a new file for monitoring
2	Check integrity of a specific file
3	Scan all monitored files
4	List all monitored files
5	Update baseline hash for a modified file
6	Remove a file from monitoring
7	Exit the program
 How It Works

When a file is registered, its SHA-256 hash, size, and timestamp are stored.

On each integrity check:

The file is re-hashed

Hashes and sizes are compared

Status is updated as:

intact

modified

deleted

All records are saved in integrity_database.json.

 Example Use Cases

Detect unauthorized changes to critical system files

Monitor configuration or log files

Educational demonstration of cryptographic hashing

Basic intrusion detection support

 Security Notes

Uses SHA-256, a secure cryptographic hashing algorithm

Reads files in chunks to efficiently handle large files

Absolute paths prevent duplicate or ambiguous file tracking

 Sample Output
 File intact: config.txt
 ALERT: File modified: data.json
 WARNING: File 'logs.txt' has been deleted!
